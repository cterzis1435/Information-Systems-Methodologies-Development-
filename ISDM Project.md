## Executive Summary
This report outlines the analysis of an existing information system, the in-house Call Management Centre (CMC), at a major travel agency. It will offer a proposal of an improved system, that will provide assistance to employees at the agency, Relationship Managers (RM), so that they can provide a high quality, efficient service for customers, in order to improve company sales. In order to elicit requirements and generate an understanding of the overall system, analysis of the company’s description was undertaken, and any gaps in understanding were assumed.

## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to introduce an upgraded call management centre system, to improve the operations of a major travel company, helping them generate more sales. Due to the varying number and nature of their products (holiday travel packages) their current system is complicated. The new system aims to provide a tool that simplifies business processes and matches customers with specific RMs who can provide tailored services according to their skill profiles. The project implementation will enable the ability to provide a more specific and efficient service and establish strong customer relationships, resulting in repeat sales with loyal customers.

## Problem Definition
Creating strong customer relationships and improving service is a key goal for the major travel agency, as this provides them with greater sales and an advanced mechanism for employee-to-customer communication. Currently, their system doesn’t deliver their service to the standard of quality and efficiency that they desire. The stagnant status of their operations signals the need for change, in order to meet their long-term operational objectives. To upgrade their call centre management system, the procedures of communication should be re-designed, via improved call routing and dynamic flow control for both inbound and outbound calls and by aiding employees such as Relationship Managers (RM) in serving customers, through profile matching mechanisms. In this way, the travel agency can streamline their operations and develop an efficient manner of communication for employees and customers, further leading to stronger sales.

## Stakeholders

*Internal*:

**Relationships Manager (RM)**
The RM is a key stakeholder in this project as they are the main users and are the employees of the travel agency who directly interact with the system and company. The requirements of RMs are important as they will impact the way in which the system is designed and implemented.

**End-customer**
The end-customer is a consumer of the services and potential buyer of the products provided by the travel agency. The system should be designed for their ease of use, as they are the stakeholders who provide sales for the travel agency.

**Shareholders**
Shareholders own a portion of the company, and thus are included as stakeholders, as they obtain partial interest in business activities. If the system fails, it impacts their position and contribution to the travel agency.

*External:*

**Media platforms**
Technological platforms, including social media applications, websites, blogs and email, are stakeholders in the travel agency as they are involved in the marketing and communications of company activity.

**Telecommunications company**
The CMC involves calling via telephone as a main function to connect customers with the company, hence the telecommunication company is involved in assuring their service supports the system.

## The Scrum Methodology & Use of Design Thinking  
Agile Methodology allows stakeholders to work collaboratively with the agile team. The team was self-organised and controls what work is completed,while being able to foster communication and collaborate effectively with each other. Agile development focuses on many different approaches, including iterations, short life cycles and completion of many short tasks. Scrum is an Agile Methodology used in our project. Scrum has allowed our team to become more cross-functional, allowing team members to complete their own work without relying on others. This approach allowed our team to become more flexible, creative and productive.

Our team has used several activities from Scrum to help us complete the project. Firstly, creating user stories was an essential task which allowed us to further understand other tasks including diagrams, empathy maps and the product backlog. The product backlog was created so our team could see what user stories had to be completed and the priority and estimation of the tasks. Additionally, we had sprints, which allowed us to visualise how much time we had remaining for sections of the project. The project had 4 sprints and each sprint was allocated a time limit. For each sprint, our team would plan ahead on what work we wanted complete within the sprint and how we would complete it. At the end of each sprint, we would review all work completed from all group members. With Github, we were able to perform this task using a function called ‘issues’, where each team member could create an issue while other team members could look at the issue and write down any comments they had on the work and review it. Through the use of the project board on GitHub, it allowed the team to understand the progress of the issues and the milestones set for the project. Overall, during the course of the project we would review the content created and update it in iterations to show the changes made allowing us to confirm the content developed.

## Point of View Statements (POV)

Relationship Manager:
* Relationship Managers need a way to improve the CMC system because the company would like to attract more end-customers.
* Relationship Managers need a way to connect with customers easily, because it makes their work more efficient.
* Relationship Managers need a way to more effectively use their skills and product knowledge, because it would help create more sales.
* A long term Relationship manager needs a way to use the new system in a similar way to the old system because it will make the transition easier to manage
* Relationship Managers need a way to easily construct their skills matrix, so that they can be matched with an appropriate customer.

End Customer:
* End customers need a way to communicate our needs in a simple manner with the travel agents in order to obtain the information we require 
* End Customers need a way to be matched with helpful and knowledgeable RMs because we need to be able to efficiently communicate our travel plans
* End Customers need a way to get assistance quickly, because we don’t like to wait for long periods of time on a call.
* End Customers need a way to be assured that our personal data is being protected when using the CMS because of the need to maintain data confidentiality 
* End Customers need a way to be able to order the travel packages chosen with the RM because that will allow us to go on the trip

## ‘How Might We’ Statements (HMW)

Relationship Managers:
* HMW improve the CMC to attract more end-customers?
* HMW connects with customers more easily to make their communication with the customer more efficient?
* HMW effectively uses our skills and product knowledge at an extensive level to help increase our sales?
* HMW get customers to be matched with the correct RM with the correct product knowledge?
* HMW create and update our skill matrix so that our profile is accurate?
* HMW use our old knowledge of the system and implement our knowledge into the use of the new system?

End-Customers:
* HMW communicates with the travel agents in a simple manner to get the information we need?
* HMW matches with a helpful and knowledgeable RM to efficiently discuss travel packages?
* HMW get quick assistance to not keep us waiting on the phone for too long?
* HMW ensure that our personal data is being protected while using the CMC System to help maintain data confidentiality 
* HMW order the travel packages that are being offered?

## Assumptions 
* There are enough RMs on shift to deal with the flow of customers on a regular day.
* Same RMs are on shift every day.
* RMs have knowledge on all of the travel packages being offered by the company.
* RMs have the ability to transfer customers on the call to different RMs who are more knowledgeable about the travel packages that are  being discussed.
* Customers are aware of the different packages being offered through the social media platforms. 
* Customers are able to order the travel packages straight from the RM.
* Customers profiles are created using the profiler tool before being matched with the appropriate RM on the phone.
* Call routing and distribution routine has information about customers to distribute call to correct RM who specialises on travel packages.

## Reflection

After analysing the travel company’s situation, it is assumed that there are enough Relationship Managers (RMs) every day, and the same RMs are hired on a full-time contract, resulting in consistency of shift and service provided. All RMs are assumed to have basic knowledge of all travel packages being offered by the travel company, however are not required to specialise in all product areas. Hence, RMs are assumed to have the capability to transfer their customer on a call to a different RM, who can assist their specific requirements. This may occur if the first RM was wrongly matched to the customer by the system, if there is a more specialised RM in the product, or other relevant reasons. Additionally, it is assumed that customers have the ability to discover the different packages the travel company offers, through other media platforms such as advertisements, a website and social media. It is further assumed that when customers get in a call with the RM, they are not only able to receive information about travel packages and other services, as well as, purchase the product they would like in the same conversation. It is assumed that prior to being matched with an appropriate RM, customer profiles are created using the Profiler Tool. The CMC System through the call routing and distribution routine has customer information necessary to properly distribute the call to the appropriate RM for the travel package requested.


We also used the Point of View statements created to empathise with stakeholders’ and understand their challenges and needs, to develop How Might We (HMW) statements. These HMW statements help us understand what is needed in the new system for the stakeholders’ to have it running effectively.

## Competitive Advantage
In successfully developing a more efficient call management centre system, the travel agency’s operational and financial status could improve, hence potentially gaining a competitive advantage amongst the tourism industry.

By developing profiling and matching tools, customers are better able to connect with informed relationship managers (RM), who specialise in the demands of the particular customer calling. In this way, RMs can efficiently address customers’ needs and confidently answer their questions, providing a better quality service. This not only leads to stronger customer relationships, but also retains customer loyalty and would thus generate repeat sales. This advantageously differentiates the company from other travel agencies, as the company provides a specialised service, which benefits customers more than traditional services. Hence, due to the change in system operations, the company would gain a stronger competitive advantage.

Due to the system change, there might be improved employee morale, as they can focus more on providing good service based on their strengths. This would establish a more attractive workplace for employees to want to work at, developing a positive image for the company and placing them at a stronger competitive advantage. Customers would also value being able to speak with a knowledgeable and skillful RM, increasing their satisfaction with the company and potentially leading to positive feedback and reviews. This would boost the company’s reputation, which would heavily strengthen their position amongst competition.

As communication becomes more efficient, due to queuing and rerouting functions in the proposed system, calls would become quicker, meaning the company would be able to get through more customers in the same amount of time as before. Additionally, by redesigning the call routing and distribution routine, inbound call costs are minimized as per-call handling time is reduced. These innovative changes save on company costs, enabling increased profits in the long-term and hence better positioning within the competitive tourism market.


## Possible Adverse Effects If Project Failure
If the proposed project implementation were to fail, this would result in various adverse impacts on the social, financial and operational aspects of the company.
Foremost, investments made for the planning, tools and other labour involved in the implementation of the project would be lost, which could negatively impact the travel agency’s profits and long-term financial position. The company would now have to spend further allocated time and money on developing and testing a new system or instead planning how to modify the system to implement it successfully. This would cause delays in future business plans, for example expansion or differentiation plans, inhibiting their abilities to fulfil their business objectives.
Employees of the travel agency also become unfavourably impacted by the system project failure, as they may become frustrated and unmotivated to perform their tasks, due to the disruptive changes in the workplace. This may lead to weaker customer relationships and hence decreased total sales generated. This impact may reflect in social aspects, such as reputational damage, where the company may be seen as incapable of producing and implementing a functional system, potentially impacting their corporate status and relationship with other businesses.
